# 📌Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning algorithms enhanced with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for feature selection.
As part of my undergraduate journey, I built this project to explore how data-driven methods can assist in early disease detection, which plays a vital role in improving healthcare outcomes.

## ⚙️ Models Used

I experimented with multiple supervised ML models to classify patients as at risk or not at risk of kidney disease:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Naïve Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🔬 Special Techniques

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): Applied for intelligent feature selection, mimicking the foraging behavior of ants to identify the most influential health indicators.

Pearson Correlation: Used to analyze relationships between medical features.

Data Preprocessing: Included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalization.

## 📊 Results & Insights

Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

ACO significantly improved the selection of key medical attributes, making the predictions more meaningful.

The project demonstrates how bio-inspired optimization techniques can strengthen traditional ML models in healthcare.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

## 🌱 Learning Journey

This project is part of my undergraduate learning path. I’m still experimenting, making mistakes, and improving — but every step helps me grow as a data science enthusiast passionate about applying AI in healthcare.
